  "The suite under ClojureScript.

  prolly-tree is the index kotobase hydrates from inside both Workers, and eight of its tests exist only on the ClojureScript side (async reads) -- so the cljs half is not a subset of the JVM half, it is additional coverage.

  This repo had no ClojureScript entry, so the murakumo fleet could only
  gate its JVM half. Counts were measured to match before this was added --
  that measurement, not the `.cljc` extension, is what earns a second gate.
  Measured 2026-08-17 on datom-source: a portable suite can be green on the
  JVM and red under nbb for reasons production does not have (SCI deftype
  behaviour), so `.cljc` alone is not grounds.
