  "Content-addressed probabilistic B-tree (Prolly Tree) over CID-addressed
  dag-cbor blocks.

  Ports for storage are injected -- `put!` (cid, bytes -> ignored, called
  once per node built) and `get-fn` (cid -> bytes) are passed in by the
  caller. This namespace performs no I/O itself.

  Chunk boundaries are probabilistic (~1/256 average chunk size), matching
  the deleted kotoba-store Rust implementation. LEAF-level boundaries are
  keyed on the entry's key; INTERNAL-level boundaries are keyed on the
  CHILD's CID, never on the child's max-key -- keying an internal boundary
  on max-key re-triggers the same boundary decision at every level for the
  same key, which is an infinite-recursion bug the original Rust
  implementation hit and fixed.

  Update: `multiformats.core/sha256` and `cbor.core/encode` have grown real
  `:cljs` branches (SHA-256 via @noble/hashes, portable CBOR byte buffers).
  `utf8-bytes` below used `.getBytes` unconditionally despite the `.cljc`
  extension -- a genuine gap in this namespace's own portability, not just
  its dependencies' -- now split per-platform. Verified end to end under
  ClojureScript (nbb), not just reasoned about: `build-tree`/`lookup` run
  and byte-identically match the :clj path for the same input.

  Update 2 (tag-42): child references in internal nodes are now REAL IPLD
  links -- CBOR tag 42 over the binary CID, via `kotoba-lang/ipld` -- not
  plain CID strings. This closes the honesty note the first landing
  carried (`cbor.core` had no tag support then; it does now). A generic
  DAG-CBOR/IPFS tool can walk the tree. NOTE: this changes every node's
  bytes and therefore every CID -- a clean break, nothing in production
  consumed the old format (see superproject ADR). Boundary math is
  unchanged (still keyed on the child's CID string), so tree SHAPE is
  identical; only the on-block encoding moved."
