  "Structural diff of two Prolly Tree roots: what changed between them, computed
  by SKIPPING every subtree whose CID is already equal.

  This is the primitive the whole point of content addressing rests on, and it
  is worth being precise about why. Two trees built over 4,000 keys that differ
  in 15 of them share almost every block, because chunk boundaries are content-
  derived: a changed key rewrites its own leaf chunk and the spine above it, and
  nothing else. So a comparison that descends only where the child CIDs differ
  reads O(changed x depth) blocks instead of O(n). Without this, a root CID is
  just a checksum — you can tell that two fleets differ, but not how, and you
  are back to scanning the whole manifest (com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2608040200,
  which names this namespace as the first thing to build).

  Correctness rests on one fact: **if two subtrees have the same CID they hold
  exactly the same [k v] set**, and keys are unique within a tree, so a key
  inside a shared subtree cannot also appear anywhere else in either tree. It is
  therefore sound to drop shared subtrees entirely rather than to descend and
  compare their entries.

  `get-fn` is the same block-reading port `prolly-tree.core` takes: `(get-fn
  cid) -> bytes`. Nothing here does I/O of its own."
