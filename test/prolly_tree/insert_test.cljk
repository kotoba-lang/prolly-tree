  "History independence is the whole contract.

  A prolly tree earns its place by producing the same CIDs for the same logical
  content no matter how that content was assembled. If an incremental insert
  can produce a tree a rebuild would not, then two replicas holding identical
  data can disagree about their root hash, and every equality check above this
  layer -- CAS, dedup, replication -- is quietly wrong. So the property is
  asserted directly, over randomized key sets and insertion orders, rather than
  spot-checked on a hand-picked example."
