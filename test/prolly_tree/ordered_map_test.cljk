  "A real Prolly tree on one side of the oracle.

  The contract's own suite compares two adapters built from lifted
  predicates, which proves the adaptation arithmetic. It does not prove that
  this substrate does what it declares. Here the rows come out of an actual
  tree -- built, chunked, and scanned through `core/scan-range` -- so the
  declaration in `prolly-tree.ordered-map/profile` is checked against
  behaviour rather than against a reading of the source.

  Enough keys to force more than one leaf, because a single-leaf tree never
  exercises the child pruning where a bound is compared against a subtree
  span rather than a key."
