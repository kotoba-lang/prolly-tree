  "Inclusion proofs, and the forgeries they have to refuse.

  A proof API is only worth having if the negative cases are the ones under
  test. A `verify` that returns truthy for an honest proof and was never shown
  a dishonest one has demonstrated nothing -- so the honest round-trip here is
  three deftests and the refusals are ten.

  Both halves of `verify` were checked by mutation rather than assumed: with
  the CID check removed `a-well-formed-block-that-lies-about-the-value` goes
  red, and with the descent check weakened to `accept any genuine child`
  `a-shadow-path-to-a-second-copy-of-the-key` goes red. A refusal nobody has
  watched fail is a refusal nobody has tested."
