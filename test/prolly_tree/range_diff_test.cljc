  "`range-diff` — the diff restricted to a key window.

  Two claims, and they need different kinds of test. That the answer is right
  is checked against `diff` itself, over many random windows: interval
  arithmetic goes wrong by dropping keys, and a dropped key is invisible in
  the result. That the answer is CHEAP is checked with block counters, because
  a range walk that quietly read the whole tree and filtered at the end would
  satisfy every correctness assertion here."
