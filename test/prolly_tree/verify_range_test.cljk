  "`verify-range` -- and the one question it exists to settle.

  `verify` proves ONE pair to a party holding only the root. The obvious next
  ask is `and is that ALL of them, between these two keys?`, and that ask splits
  into two claims which look alike and are not:

    C1  `this is what scan-range returns for [lo, hi) under this root`
    C2  `this is every fact in [lo, hi)`

  C1 is expected to be provable from the proof blocks alone, at zero extra
  bytes, because an internal node carries EVERY child's [max-key, link] inside
  the bytes its own CID names -- so a verifier can recompute the pruning rule
  and demand exactly the children it keeps. C2 is expected NOT to be provable,
  because pruning on a max-key is trusting a claim the prover chose, and no
  block says the claim is true.

  So this namespace has two controls rather than a happy path and some
  refusals, and BOTH outcomes are the result:

    the C1 controls MUST be refused -- if a short or substituted proof is
    accepted, C1 is false as well and there is no range proof here at all;

    the C2 control MUST be accepted -- `an-understated-max-key-hides-a-key-
    and-the-proof-is-still-accepted` builds a tree `build-tree` cannot produce,
    where a max-key is understated and the subtree behind it really does hold a
    key in the window. The prover prunes it, an honest verifier prunes in
    exactly the same place, and the short answer verifies. That acceptance is
    the finding, and it is asserted on purpose.

  Every refusal was watched failing rather than assumed, which this repo
  already insists on for `verify` (`a refusal nobody has watched fail is a
  refusal nobody has tested`). Measured by mutating `prolly-tree.core`:

    make `verify-range` walk every child instead of calling `range-spans` --
      a verifier following a different rule from the prover, which is the one
      thing `descend-cid` says must never happen -- and SIX tests go RED: both
      C2 tests, the oracle, the cost test, and two of the refusals. The C2
      acceptances are load-bearing on the verifier pruning where the PROVER
      pruned, not where it would be safe to.

    make `range-spans` prune the last child on the span's +infinity `upper`
      instead of on the claimed max-key -- i.e. borrow `diff/span-intersects?`
      wholesale -- and `the-last-childs-claim-is-trusted-too-and-diff-
      disagrees` goes RED, alone, on exactly its two assertions.
      This mutation was RUN FIRST, against the OTHER C2 test, and reddened
      NOTHING: `upper` and the claimed max-key are the same value for every
      child except the last, so a fixture understating the FIRST child cannot
      see the difference. The last-child test exists because of that miss. A
      mutation that changes no answer has tested no assertion, and the way to
      find out is to run it rather than to reason about it.

    delete the surplus check and `both-the-honest-leaf-and-the-impostor-is-
      refused` goes RED -- and only that one, which is the point of adding the
      impostor rather than swapping it: with a swap, the omission fires first
      and the surplus check is never reached.

    delete the `in-span?` check and `a-leaf-outside-the-span-its-parent-claims-
      is-refused` goes RED, alone.

    make `demand` fall back to any block in the archive instead of throwing,
      and `dropping-any-block-the-rule-keeps-is-refused` and
      `a-wrong-root-is-refused` go RED -- then the run has to be KILLED, which
      is the more interesting half. Substituting a block for a missing one
      re-enters the walk at a node it has already passed, and the walk has no
      fixed point: it recurses without bound, re-collecting every sibling leaf
      at every level. The refusal is not only what keeps the answer honest, it
      is what makes the walk terminate.

  The cost claim is tested separately from the correctness claim, because a
  verifier that quietly needed a block the scan never read would satisfy every
  assertion about what it returned. `arrangement`'s suite makes the same
  argument for counting BYTES and not only blocks: a block count with no byte
  count is half a claim."

  (testing "THE C2 CONTROL, and it must be ACCEPTED. The acceptance is the
            finding, not a defect to fix here.

  `build-tree` cannot produce this tree: the first child's max-key is
  UNDERSTATED, so `range-spans` skips that child for any window starting above
  the understated claim -- while the subtree behind it really does hold every
  key in that window. The prover prunes there. An honest verifier, which must
  prune exactly where the prover pruned or it would refuse honest proofs,
  prunes there too. So it accepts an answer that is empty when the truth is
  hundreds of rows.

  This is the whole of the difference between C1 and C2. `verify-range` proves
  `this is what scan-range returns for this root`, which is true here. It does
  not prove `this is every fact in the range`, which is false here, and no
  quantity of blocks from this tree can distinguish the two -- the lie is about
  a subtree the rule never asks for, so it is not in the proof at all.

  Closing this would take a different commitment (max-keys derived from, or
  signed by, something the prover does not choose), not a stricter verifier.
  A verifier strict enough to catch it would have to descend into subtrees the
  prover pruned, which is the whole scan, which is the thing a range proof
  exists not to do."

  (testing "the second C2 shape, and the one place two namespaces in this repo
            answer the same question differently.

  `core/range-spans` prunes on the CLAIMED max-key. `diff/span-intersects?`
  prunes on the span, where the last child's upper bound is +infinity, so it
  keeps a last child whose max-key is understated and `scan-range` does not.
  Both are defensible. Neither closes C2:

    trusting the claim (what `scan-range` does) hides the keys, and the proof
    still verifies, because the verifier prunes in the same place;

    distrusting it (what `diff` does) would make the verifier demand a block
    the prover never read, so every honest proof would be refused.

  So the conservative rule is not a fix for C2 that this repo merely has not
  adopted yet. It buys nothing a verifier can use, and it is stated here so
  nobody spends a wire format finding that out."
